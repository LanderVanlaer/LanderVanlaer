# I'm a Developer!!

I am a passionate AI Developer with a strong drive for innovation and technology. My journey in programming began at the age of thirteen, evolving into a career focused on AI development and backend engineering.

With interests in artificial intelligence, data models, and algorithms, I specialize in building scalable and efficient solutions to complex problems. My ability to leverage cutting-edge technologies allows me to create high-performance systems that drive innovation.

Over the past year, I have worked extensively with diagnostics, utilizing OpenTelemetry in .NET to enhance observability and performance monitoring. Gained experience in Infrastructure as Code with Pulumi, optimizing cloud deployments and infrastructure management. And additionally, I have been actively involved in developing chatbots, integrating AI-driven solutions to improve user interactions and automation.
